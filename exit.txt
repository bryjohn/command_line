PROLOG         top

       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or
       the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME         top

       exit — cause the shell to exit

SYNOPSIS         top

       exit [n]

DESCRIPTION         top

       The exit utility shall cause the shell to exit with the exit status
       specified by the unsigned decimal integer n.  If n is specified, but
       its value is not between 0 and 255 inclusively, the exit status is
       undefined.

       A trap on EXIT shall be executed before the shell terminates, except
       when the exit utility is invoked in that trap itself, in which case
       the shell shall exit immediately.

OPTIONS         top

       None.

OPERANDS         top

       See the DESCRIPTION.

STDIN         top

       Not used.

INPUT FILES         top

       None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top

       None.

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top

       Default.

STDOUT         top

       Not used.

STDERR         top

       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES         top

       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top

       None.

EXIT STATUS         top

       The exit status shall be n, if specified. Otherwise, the value shall
       be the exit value of the last command executed, or zero if no command
       was executed. When exit is executed in a trap action, the last
       command is considered to be the command that executed immediately
       preceding the trap action.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top

       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE         top

       None.

EXAMPLES         top

       Exit with a true value:

           exit 0

       Exit with a false value:

           exit 1

RATIONALE         top

       As explained in other sections, certain exit status values have been
       reserved for special uses and should be used by applications only for
       those purposes:

        126    A file to be executed was found, but it was not an executable
               utility.

        127    A utility to be executed was not found.

       >128    A command was interrupted by a signal.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top

       None.
